                Descriptions for C++ final project
Our team has chosen the project topic which is robot simulation. The idea is that there are some virtual
robots used to explore an unknown terrain. The robot starts with a vague information about the surroundings,
and as the robot goes around it learns more about the environment it refines its information regarding where 
it can go and cannot go. We design the specific test environment based on the 2D-coordinate system, therefore, 
we can get the location as the coordinate form at all the time. In addition, we will add some obstacles randomly. 
The robot we designed have a test range regard to the radius of r which have three zones. When the robot meet 
the obstacle, it can automatically recognize that and give back the obstacle information in the first zone, 
alert in the second zone and finally change direction in the third zone. Also when two robots meet with each other, 
they can take action to avoid collision. However, the direction of turning is depending on what we have set, 
and it can be changed to what we need. All in all, in our assumption, 
the robot can move to any place with different speeds except running into obstacles, meanwhile, 
it can feedback its location information.
The project can achieve the function as following:
1. Set the robot speed and size at the any time.
2. Build the 2D- coordinate as the test environment.
3. Get the robot location when it meets the obstacle and moves free.
4. Change the turning ways freely.
